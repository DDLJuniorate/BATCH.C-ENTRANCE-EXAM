     <h2>Reading Passage: THE NAUGHT BOY</h2>
    <p> Dane was the only child of Mr. and Mrs. David. He was regarded by everyone as a spoilt child. 
	    The parents, however, never saw anything wrong in whatever he did. He was their darling child, 
	    and they would not have anybody speak ill of him.</p>
	<p>As a result, Dane continued to be rude to grown-ups. He also beat up weaker children.  
		People complained to Danes parents, but they would deny that their son did such things. So would neither beat nor scold Dane.</p>
		
	<p>Everybody in the area got to know Dare for his rudeness. They also believed that his parents supported him. Hence, 
		they told their children to keep away from Dane. At first, Dane pretended as if he did not mind. He thought that 
		if the children in his area would not play with him, some of his friends at school would. When he got to school however,
		he discovered that they too would neither speak nor play with him. Instead, they stayed in groups and called him names.</p>
	<p>Dane became so miserable that he could not concentrate on his studies. He started doing badly in his school work and his
		parents felt concerned. </p>
	<p>Then, an unusual thing happened. One night, when Dane was sleeping. He had a dream he saw his grandmother who scolded 
		him for his bad behaviour. She then advised him to be a good boy, to respect his elders always and to be humble, 
		and then he would be happy again. </p>
	<p>Dane felt relieved. When he woke up the next morning, he greeted his parents and even his neighbours. On his way to 
		school, he came across his mates. He went up to them and asked for their forgiveness. He also apologized to Audu for 
		calling him a pauper on one occasion. And by the time they got to the school gate, they were chatting away happily.</p>
	<p>Everybody was surprised at Daneâ€™s change of attitude but they were happy. Dane too, was happy. He was able to read hard again.</p>
