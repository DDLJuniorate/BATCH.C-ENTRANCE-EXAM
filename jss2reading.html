    <h2>Reading Passage: </h2>
    <p>   
	Indecent dressing has become prevalent among the youth in Nigeria. Every person is fashion conscious and fashion 
    is very popular among school boys and girls. They dress in a competitive spirit to look smart, up-to-date and 
    attractive in a bid to meet up with fashion and they spend a lot of money to the detriment of their parents. 
    Teens craze for fashion can be traced to their identifying with particular celebrities whom they like. 
    Such celebrities wear big hats, bogus dressing, tight fitted wears, short dresses and so on.</p>
	<p>Stephen Alumona a sociologist said the increase in rape cases in the country is as a result of indecent 
    dressing among the youths. He further states that there is no reason for a child from a good home to dress indecently.
    Indecent dressing ranges from showing of laps, breasts, tummy and even pants or tights as the case may be. 
    A situation where grandmothers and women who are highly placed dress indecently calls for Gods intervention.</p>
	<p>According to Ojuolape, indecent dressing is a mark of irresponsibility and radicalism that is common in the campuses. 
    People lose their decency when they dress indecently. It makes them look cheap and stupid.</p>
